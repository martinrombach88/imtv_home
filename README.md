A freelance project for the Korean media company IMTV.
My client wanted to update a blog style media portfolio site to something more modern.
In particular, he wanted to use videos and modern style conventions to update the views.

Project was built in React using:
- Axios
- React Router
- React Player
- React Hooks Form
- Material UI and Bootstrap
